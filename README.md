## Home Page ##

Created a navs bar to be able to navigate through my multiple "pages" which is just me hiding/showing divs that protain to the link clicked
The picture in the middle is 6 individual photos. the code has a z-index of 3 other 5 have z-index of 4 so that the 5 can be on top of the middle photo
    Postioning them all is based on percentage margining so that the picture strinks and expands according to screen width

The contact section is the only mobile responsive potion i needed to do. changes when it reaches below 791px or higher than 1650px
