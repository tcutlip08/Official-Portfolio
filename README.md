#### Home Page ####

Created a navs bar to be able to navigate through my multiple "pages" which is just me hiding/showing divs that protain to the link clicked
The picture in the middle is 6 individual photos. the code has a z-index of 3 other 5 have z-index of 4 so that the 5 can be on top of the middle photo
    Postioning them all is based on percentage margining so that the picture strinks and expands according to screen width
